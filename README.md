# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness [slowly ending development]
A completely re-designed and recolored BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord FULLY black, compact in it's own way and a customizable accent.  
The theme can and will contain lots of bugs/glitches and profanity (meant as jokes).

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.
  
 **The theme is specifically made to work on Windows only! Tested on Stable and PTB/Canary**
