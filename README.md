# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored version of the BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord darker (as in literally black), compact and lightly customizable.  
The theme can and will contain bugs.

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.  

## Recommended you install HorizontalServerList with it!

*woah there didn't you say you're ending development?*  
well uh, yeah, i did- though i've decided to continue screwing around with the theme, spite it's mass of spaghetti; there might not be plans of SimplyDark v3 afterall and my pc is a LOT stronger to withstand my theme's spaghetti, so there's that!
