# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored version of the BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord darker (as in literally black), compact and lightly customizable.  
The theme can and will contain bugs.

## Theme support  
- **It's made to work with BetterDiscord *ONLY*; please avoid using other client mods like PowerCord**  
- **The theme does *NOT* support small or 4:3 resolution displays, as it *will* break elements.**  
- **The theme supports *only* Windows and is tested regularly on the *stable* branch of Discord and BetterDiscord**  
- **Do *NOT* use markdown mode as its unsupported and will break the chat box; disable it in `User Settings > Text & Images > Text Box`**

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.

*woah there didn't you say you're ending development?*  
well uh, yeah, i did- though i've decided to continue screwing around with the theme, spite it's mass of spaghetti; there might not be plans of SimplyDark v3 afterall, not to mention, my PC is a LOT stronger to withstand my theme's spaghetti, so there's that!
