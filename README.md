# SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**! **Now available for Stylus!**   
The purpose of the theme is to make discord look black with an accent of choice and compact in it's own way.  
The theme can contain lots of bugs/glitches (scroller problems at most) and profanity (clearly meant as jokes).

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.
  
   **The theme is specifically made to work on Windows only! Tested on Stable and PTB/Canary**

## Stylus - READ FIRST!

because i'm a dumb fuck and i'm handling usercss FOR THE FIRST TIME, i don't know why but it applies the theme to **EVERY WEBSITE** despite me setting it to only apply to discordapp.com cause ```@-moz-document domain("discordapp.com")``` doesn't seem to work. mainly only button radiuses and masks get changed and not colors. If you like this, you may using it, otherwise dont' get it or exclude it on every website you visit and something fucks up on it. *hmu in the issues if you know how to fix this*

## Installation for Stylus

To download the theme for **Stylus**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.user.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. Stylus should **AUTOMATICALLY** detect the raw page and open the `.user.css` installer page for you!
  3a. If not, right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it anywhere you want and drag it into the Stylus Manage page.
