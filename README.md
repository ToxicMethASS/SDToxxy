# Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored version of the BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord darker (as in literally black), compact and lightly customizable.  
The theme can and will contain bugs, especially in its current alpha state as of 2022.

## Theme support  
- **It's made to work with BetterDiscord *ONLY*; please avoid using other client mods like PowerCord**  
- **The theme does *NOT* support small or 4:3 resolution displays, as it *will* break elements.**  
- **The theme supports *only* Windows and is tested regularly on the *stable* branch of Discord and BetterDiscord.**  
- **Do *NOT* use markdown mode as its unsupported and will break the chat box; disable it in `User Settings > Text & Images > Text Box`**
- The theme is currently in a very broken and unfinished state. It is being slowly rewritten and sorted.

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your BetterDiscord theme folder.
