A completely re-designed and recolored version of the BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord more compact, customizable and debranded.  
The theme can and will contain bugs.  

## Theme support  
- **The theme is not recommended for small resolutions or 4:3 aspect ratio displays, as it *will* break elements.**  
- **The theme mainly supports Windows.**  
- **Disable "Preview emojis, mentions, and markdown syntax as you type" in `User Settings > Text & Images > Text Box` and enable "Use the legacy chat input" in `User Settings > Accessibility > Chat Input`. Having these not set properly will break the chat box.**
