# Fuchsia Darkness
A completely re-designed and recolored version of the BetterDiscord theme **SimplyDark** made by **Gibbu**!  
The purpose of the theme is to make discord more compact, customizable and debranded.  
The theme can and will contain bugs.  

## Theme support  
- **It's made to work with BetterDiscord specifically; you can freely "port" the theme locally for PowerCord**  
- **The theme is not recommended for small resolutions or 4:3 aspect ratio displays, as it *will* break elements.**  
- **The theme supports Windows and is tested on Discord PTB and the latest version of [redacted client].**  
- **Don't use markdown mode (just yet). It'll break the chat box; disable it in `User Settings > Text & Images > Text Box`**  

## Installation

To download the theme for **BetterDiscord**, follow the next steps:
  1. open `SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click the `Raw` button in the top right corner of the theme file page.
  3. once in the "raw" code view; right click the page, click `Save as...` and save it to your theme folder.
