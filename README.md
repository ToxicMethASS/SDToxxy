# Fuchsia Darkness
A compact, customizable and debranded discord theme!  
This theme contains lots of bugs and is generally unfinished in some areas.  

## Theme support  
- **This isn't recommended for small resolutions or 4:3 aspect ratio displays, as it *will* break elements.**  
- **The theme is made explicitly for Vencord on Windows**  
- **Legacy chat input *MUST* be enabled for the chatbox to render correctly.**  

## Installation

To download the theme for **Vencord**:
  1. open `FuchsiaDarkness.theme.css` in the repo.
  2. click on the **download** button in the top right corner of the theme file page and save it to your theme folder.
